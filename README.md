# Myo Mapper
Myo Mapper is an [open-source](https://opensource.org/) application to manage and send [Myo](https://www.myo.com/) data to any audio and visual software able to receive [OSC](http://opensoundcontrol.org/) and [MIDI](https://www.midi.org/) messages.
With Myo Mapper you can also send Myo data to any hardware with embedded MIDI connection through a MIDI I/O interface.
