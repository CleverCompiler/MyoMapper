# MyoMapper
MyoMapper, is an application to convert and rescale raw data from the Myo and to send them to musical applications through OSC and/or MIDI protocol.

It has been developed by [Balandino Di Donato](http://www.balandinodidonato.com) and [Jamie Bullock](http://jamiebullock.com/) at [Integra Lab](http://www.integra.io/lab).

## Get Started

- Launch [Myo Connect](https://developer.thalmic.com/downloads)
- Connect your Myo armband
- Verify that the connection is stable and Myo Connect is receiving data
- Launch MyoMapper
- Select the Myo

To map multiple Myos, launch a second Myo Mapper's instance and select a different Myo. To do so:
- Duplicate the Myo Mapper application you have already installed.
- Rename it with a different name, eg. "Myo Mapper 2"
- Launch it

## OSC Communication

MyoMapper initially sends OSC messages at the port 5432 and receive messages at the port 5431, but it can changed through the setting pannel.

### Outgoing OSC messages

| OSC tag             | Myo parameter            | Value Type               | Range       |
| :---:               | :---:                    | :---:                    |:---:        |

| `/myo+id/acceleration`       | Acc. x, Acc. y, Acc. z   | `float`, `float`, `float`      | `-PI, PI`, `-PI, PI`, `-PI, PI`     |
| `/myo+id/gyro`               | Gyro X, Gyro Y, Gyro Z   | `float`, `float`, `float`      | `-1000, 1000`, `-1000, 1000`, `-1000, 1000` |
| `/myo+id/mav`                | EMGs Mean Absolute Value | `float`                    | `0, 1`, `0, 1`, `0, 1`        |
| `/myo+id/emgScaled`          | EMG 1, EMG 2 ... EMG 8   | `float`, `float`, ... `float`  | `0, 1`, `0, 1` ... `0, 1`        |
| `/myo+id/emgRaw`             | EMG 1, EMG 2 ... EMG 8   | `int`, `int`, ... `int`        | `-127, 128`, `-127, 128` ... `-127, 128`   |
| `/myo+id/pose`               | Hand pose                | `int`, `string`              | `-1, 5` ; `"unknown", "rest",  "fist", "fingerSpread", "waveIn", "waveOut", "doubleTap"` |

### Accepted OSC messages

**NB:**
id = the value which indicates the selected Myo. It has to be an `int`, which value can be `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`.
myoValue = the value which has to be processed. It has to be a `String` which value can be `yaw`, `pitch`, `roll`, `mav`.

| OSC tag                    | Value Type | Range                     | Functions                                              |
| :---:                      | :---:      | :---:                     |  :---:                                                 |
| `/myo+id/vibrate`            | `String`   | `short`, `medium`, `long` | Makes the Myo vibrate for a short, medium or long time |
| `/myo+id/myoValue/centre`    | `String`   | `centre`                  | Centre the current value within the set range          |
| `/myo+id/myoValue/setMin`    | `float`    |  `0`, `1`                 | Set the lowest outgoing value                          |
| `/myo+id/myoValue/setMax`    | `float`    |  `0`, `1`                 | Set the highest outgoing value                         |
| `/myo+id/myoValue/reverse`   | `int`      |  `0`, `1`                 | Reverse the current value                              |

## To build on OS X

### Requirements

- [X Code](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
- [Myo Framework for Mac](https://developer.thalmic.com/downloads)
- [JUCE](https://www.juce.com/get-juce)

### Build process

- Move the Myo framework into `~/Library/Frameworks`.

  From terminal: `mv current-myo-framework-path ~/Library/Frameworks`

  If there is not any folder named Frameworks under `~/Library` then create one and move the Myo framework into it.

- Move the JUCE into `/Applications`.

  From terminal: `mv current-JUCE-path /Applications`

- Open `Myo Mapper.jucer`
- Verify that all modules are linked by clicking `config` -> `modules`
- Click `Save Project and Open in IDE`
- Build App

If any issue, please [report and issue](https://github.com/balandinodidonato/MyoMapper/issues) or [email the developer](info@balandinodidonato.com).
